Based on your current architecture (upload -> crop -> ingest/label -> store), here are concrete, prioritized suggestions to dramatically increase accuracy.
Summary: The Accuracy Strategy
Your goal is to reduce "Garbage In, Garbage Out." The accuracy of your final stored data is a product of the accuracy at each preceding step. We will improve it by:
Filtering Garbage: Prevent bad crops from ever reaching the labeling model.
Smarter Labeling: Change how you ask the model to generate labels.
Providing Context: Help the system understand the primary product in an image.
Creating a Feedback Loop: Build a mechanism to correct errors and retrain models.
1. Improve the Cropping Stage (Filter the Garbage)
This is the most critical step. A perfect labeling model will still fail if you feed it a picture of a human foot and ask it to identify a piece of clothing.
Problem: The YOLO model produces low-quality and irrelevant crops (skin, background, partial items).
Solutions:
A. Implement a Post-Crop Validation/Filtering Step:
Before you even think about labeling a crop, you must validate it. Add a new step between "Cropping" and "Ingesting."
How: Create a simple but fast classifier. Its only job is to look at a crop and answer: "Is this a valid clothing item?"
Option 1 (ML-based): Train a small, fast classification model (e.g., a MobileNetV2) on a dataset you create of "good crops" vs. "bad crops" (images of skin, feet, blurry sections, backgrounds).
Option 2 (Heuristic-based): Implement simple rules. Discard crops that are too small (e.g., less than 50x50 pixels), have a very strange aspect ratio (e.g., 10:1), or have low variance in color (likely a flat background).
Result: Only high-quality, relevant crops are passed to the expensive labeling stage. This immediately improves data quality and saves computational resources.
B. Improve the Core Segmentation Model:
Your current YOLO model is a general clothing detector. You can make it better.
How:
Fine-Tuning: Collect all the bad crops your system generates. Manually label them as a new class, like ignore or background. Fine-tune your YOLO model on this enhanced dataset. This teaches it to actively ignore irrelevant regions.
Use a Better Model: Instead of YOLO which produces bounding boxes, consider a segmentation model (like Mask R-CNN or a Transformer-based one like DETR). These models output a pixel-perfect "mask" for each item, which results in much cleaner crops with no background noise.
File Impact: core/cloth_detection/yolo.py
2. Improve the Labeling Stage (Smarter Labeling)
Problem: Your current labeling strategy is inefficient and prone to error. You are asking the model to pick one best label from a huge, combinatorially generated list (style + pattern + color + category).
Solution: Deconstruct the Labeling Task
Instead of asking one giant, complex question, ask several simple, independent questions. This is a far more robust and accurate approach.
How: For each validated crop, run the CLIP model multiple times against smaller, curated vocabularies.
Identify Category: Compare the image against a clean list of categories: ["t-shirt", "jeans", "sweater", "dress", "shorts", "shoes", "socks"]. Get the best match (e.g., "shorts").
Identify Color: Compare the image against a list of colors: ["blue", "black", "white", "red", "green", "cyan", "brown"]. Get the best match (e.g., "cyan").
Identify Pattern: Compare against ["solid", "striped", "plaid", "checkered", "graphic"]. Get the best match (e.g., "solid").
Identify Style: Compare against ["sporty", "casual", "formal", "vintage"]. Get the best match (e.g., "sporty").
Store the result as structured data, not a single string. Your ImageDB model should change.
Generated python
# In models/image.py
class ImageDB(ImageBase, table=True):
    # ... existing fields
    label: Optional[dict] = Field(default=None, sa_column=Column(JSON))
    # Deprecate the old string-based label field
Use code with caution.
Python
The stored label would now be: {"category": "shorts", "color": "cyan", "pattern": "solid", "style": "sporty"}.
Benefit: This is exponentially more accurate. A model is much better at identifying "blue" than it is at distinguishing between "sporty solid blue shorts" and "casual solid blue shorts" in a single shot. It also solves your missing vocabulary problem, as you can manage these smaller lists easily.
File Impact: core/embedding/label_for_img.py, models/image.py.
3. Improve the Workflow (Provide Context)
Problem: Your system treats all crops from an image as independent items. A crop of a shoe from a product image of pants is just as important as the crop of the pants themselves. This adds noise.
Solution: Establish the "Primary Item"
Your workflow needs to know which piece of clothing is the actual product being sold.
How:
Modify the Upload Endpoint: When a user uploads an image, allow them to provide an optional product_name or primary_category string (e.g., "Slim Fit Jeans").
Implement a "Best Match" Heuristic: After you have generated the structured labels for all valid crops from that image, compare each crop's label to the product_name.
You can use simple text similarity (e.g., does the product_name contain the crop's category label?).
The crop with the highest similarity score is marked as the is_primary=True item. The others are is_primary=False.
Prioritize the Primary Vector: When creating the final vector for recommendations, you can give more weight to the primary item's vector.
Result: Your database now distinguishes between the main product and other clothing items that happen to be in the photo, preventing recommendation pollution.
4. Create a Data-Quality Flywheel (Human-in-the-Loop)
Problem: No ML model is perfect. You need a way to correct its mistakes and use those corrections to make the model better over time.
Solution: Build a Simple Correction UI
How:
Create a simple, internal-facing web page (an "Admin Tool").
This page fetches an image and its system-generated structured label from your database.
It displays the image and provides dropdown menus for an admin to correct the category, color, pattern, or style.
When the admin saves the correction, you update the record in your database.
The Flywheel Effect:
Immediate Benefit: The accuracy of your stored data is now perfect for every item a human has reviewed.
Long-Term Benefit: You are building a high-quality, human-verified dataset. After correcting a few thousand images, you can use this dataset to fine-tune your models (both the cropper and the labeler), drastically improving the baseline accuracy for all future uploads. This is how you achieve state-of-the-art performance.
