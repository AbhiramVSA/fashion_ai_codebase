Ideal Team (8-10 people)

Add: Senior ML Engineer, Additional Backend Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Data Engineer

Experience Requirements
Essential Background

E-commerce platforms - Understanding of product catalogs, search systems
High-traffic systems - 10K+ concurrent users, horizontal scaling
Real-time processing - Sub-second response times, async workflows
Image processing - Format optimization, thumbnail generation, quality control

Highly Valuable Experience

Fashion/retail domain knowledge
Visual search systems - Pinterest, Google Lens-style applications

Project Complexity Indicators
High Complexity Elements

Multi-modal AI pipeline (vision + text matching)
Real-time vector similarity at scale
Complex async task orchestration with error recovery
Multi-database consistency (PostgreSQL + ChromaDB + MinIO)
Human-in-the-loop workflows for quality control

Timeline Estimate

MVP (basic functionality): 6-8 months with full team
Production-ready: 12-15 months including optimization, testing, deployment
Scale to 100K+ products: Additional 6-12 months for performance tuning

Budget Range

Development team: $150K-$300K/month depending on location and seniority
Infrastructure costs: $5K-$50K/month scaling with usage
Third-party services: $2K-$10K/month (monitoring, analytics, etc.)

This is definitely a senior-level, multi-disciplinary project that requires substantial expertise across multiple domains. Not suitable for junior developers or small teams without significant ML and distributed systems experience.
