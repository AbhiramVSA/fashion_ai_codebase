this is the machine leraning service, where the models can run locally, only light-wheigth models are recommended in the local dev enveriment. Incase of more robust or sota models. we can utilize models provided in cloud envirments like run-pod. or for flexibility we can configure wich model can be runned in this ml service, and deploy the image to one of cloud providers plataform. for now we will utilize light weigth models for prototyping. this ml service should be stateless, all the state logic and pipeline is controlled by the backed app with the task maneger celery.
